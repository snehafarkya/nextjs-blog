## Introduction

The 2000-year-old city of Petra is among one of the seven wonders of the world. An interesting city covered with desert, towering rocks, beautiful canyons, red sand, and a lot of tourist attractions. Petra is situated between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea in Jordan. Petra, a city that was carved directly into the face of a red, pink, white, and sandstone cliff, was "lost" to Western civilization for hundreds of years. Thereafter, it is popularly known as **the lost city.**

You must be wondering by now why we call it a Rose city?

That's because the color of the stones used in its building was red. In 1985, UNESCO designated it as a world heritage site. The monument is called **Al Khazna: The Treasury**

If you like an adventure in your life, you must visit Petra at least once. It is enormously beautiful with a view of fascinating sunsets, old civilizations, mud houses, rock climbing and what not? But how are local inhabitants making it to life? How do they come to have water and where do they live?

Terrifying! Right? There's this one thing popping in my brain continuously. How do people survive in Petra without any gadgets, properly resourced water, or even a clock?

After researching well, I found my answer. They have a cool water management system. The Nabataeans built their city's water infrastructure.
